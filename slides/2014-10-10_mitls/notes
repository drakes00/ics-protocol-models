Q1. Recall how it works

Q2. Security properties offered by miTLS
    Security properties are proven at the protocol level, assuming that the crypto used are strong (eg. IND-CCA2).
    Privacy and integrity againt a probabilistic and polynomial adversary even using chosen adaptative plaintext and ciphertext attacks.
    The record keys are used only when the negotiation is finished.
    Security is verified using the F7 language which is a typechecker for F#.
    It enables to specify logical annotations and verify them by typing.

Q3. Can we deploy SFTP over miTLS
    Probably not SFTP because it relies on SSH. However, FTPS is FTP over TLS/SSL.
    Moreover, the authors of miTLS say one of their main goal is to respect TLS standard compliance.
    So it should be ok to used miTLS instead of TLS in FTPS.

Q4. How to deploy miTLS
    Source code is written in F# which can be installed on Linux
    (using a debian package and need the open source version of .NET, mono).
    HOWEVER, miTLS implementation is written in F# and it seems that protocol using it should be re-implemented to use it.
