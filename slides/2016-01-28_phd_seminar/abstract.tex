\abstract{
Recently medias showed an increasing number of attacks against industrial
systems.
Such attacks become feasible because these systems are recently spreading
geographically and communicating more and more through unsafe mediums like
Internet.
As industrial systems historically have been isolated from the rest of the world,
there cybersecurity does not meet the level of our daily-life machines which are
used to be targeted by hackers around the world.
People are starting to realize that industry must quickly enhance its
cybersecurity level to avoid massive attacks such as Stuxnet in Iran.

Within this thesis, we look at different ways to increase the security level of
industrial systems and blend in usual formal methods of security.
We first look at applicative filtering of industrial protocols and we propose
rules to detect or block malicious packets relying on the semantics of the
messages.
Then we use classic protocol modelization tools such as Proverif to check the
security properties that are claimed by these protocols.
Finally, we design a formal model to express the behavior of possible attackers
in a system and to generate attack scenarios.
