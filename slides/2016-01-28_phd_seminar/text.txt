Hello, my name is Maxime.
I am a second year PhD Student supervised by Marie-Laure Potet and Jean-Louis
Roch.
I obtained a Master in computer science security named SAFE in apprenticeship
in Morpho.
It gave me a wide view of security.

Today I will talk on how to filter and verify applicative flows in industrial
systems.

Industrial systems are often seen as big rooms with a lot of screen displaying
colorful pictures.
These rooms are called SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition).
SCADA communicates with PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller) which dispatch
commands to the physical devices.

Recently, there was a lot of attacks against industrial systems (e.g.: in
Ukrain or in Isreal two days ago).

It became a priority for government including in France where quite some laws
have been voted recently.
