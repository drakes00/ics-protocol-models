  Abstract                 = {The International Atomic Energy Agency's activities relating to nuclear safety are based upon a number of premises. First and foremost, each Member State bears full responsibility for the safety of its nuclear facilities. States can be advised, but they cannot be relieved of this responsibility. Secondly, much can be gained by exchang- ing experience; lessons learned can prevent accidents. Finally, the image of nuclear safety is international; a serious accident anywhere affects the public's view of nuclear power everywhere. With the intention of strengthening the IAEA's contribution to ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants, leading experts in nuclear safety were invited by the Agency to form the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG). This group serves as a forum for the exchange of information and for the provision of advice to the IAEA on nuclear safety issues of international significance. INSAG seeks not only to identify such issues, but also to draw conclusions on the basis of research on nuclear safety and operational experience. It advises on areas where addi- tional efforts are required. Where possible, it seeks to formulate common safety concepts. The present report deals with the concept of defence in depth in nuclear and radiation safety, discussing its objectives, strategy, implementation and future devel- opment. The report is intended for use by governmental authorities and by the nuclear industry and its supporting organizations. It is intended to stimulate discussion and to promote practical action at all levels to enhance safety. I am pleased to have received this report and am happy to release it to a wider audience.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper surveys existing and new security issues affect- ing the EMV electronic payments protocol. We first introduce a new price/effort point for the cost of deploying eavesdropping and relay at- tacks – a microcontroller-based interceptor costing less than $100. We look next at EMV protocol failures in the back-end security API, where we describe two new attacks based on chosen-plaintext CBC weaknesses, and on key separation failues. We then consider future modes of attack, specifically looking at combining the phenomenon of phishing (sending unsolicited messages by email, post or phone to trick users into divulging their account details) with chip card sabotage. Our proposed attacks ex- ploit covert channels through the payments network to allow sabotaged cards to signal back their PINS. We hope these new recipes will enliven the debate about the pros and cons of Chip and PIN at both technical and commercial levels.},

  Abstract                 = {“Non-repudiation”, a well known concept in security engineering, provides measures to ensure that participants in a communication process cannot deny having participated. This concept is of eminent importance in business cases based on service oriented architectures (e.g. electronic billing). However, there is no sophisticated standard implementing fair Non-repudiation in such an environment. In this paper, we will introduce a framework providing fair Non-repudiation for Web service messages. It implements an arbitrary, pre-defined protocol using Web services technology, but completely hides the protocol execution from the target Web services. To allow the integration of security requirements in an early stage of the development cycle, a model-driven configuration approach is used. Furthermore, the procedure is not tied to Non-repudiation protocols only, which means that a broad range of protocols can be integrated in a similar way. The framework presented in this paper leverages existing standards and protocols for an efficient adoption in service oriented architectures.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, Nenadić et al. (2004) proposed the RSA-CEGD protocol for certified delivery of e-goods. This is a relatively complex scheme based on verifiable and recoverable encrypted signatures (VRES) to guarantee properties such as strong fairness and non-repudiation, among others. In this paper, we illustrate how an extended logic of beliefs can be helpful to analyze in a formal manner these security properties. This approach requires the previous definition of some novel constructions to deal with evidences exchanged by parties during the protocol execution. The study performed within this framework reveals the lack of non-repudiation in RSA-CEGD and points out some other weaknesses.},

We develop a verified reference implementation of TLS 1.2. Our code fully supports its wire formats, ciphersuites, sessions and connections, re-handshakes and resumptions, alerts and errors, and data fragmentation, as prescribed in the RFCs; it interoperates with mainstream web browsers and servers. At the same time, our code is carefully structured to enable its modular, automated verification, from its main API down to computational assumptions on its cryptographic algorithms. Our implementation is written in F# and specified in F7. We present security specifications for its main components, such as authenticated stream encryption for the record layer and key establishment for the handshake. We describe their verification using the F7 typechecker. To this end, we equip each cryptographic primitive and construction of TLS with a new typed interface that captures its security properties, and we gradually replace concrete implementations with ideal functionalities. We finally typecheck the protocol state machine, and obtain precise security theorems for TLS, as it is implemented and deployed. We also revisit classic attacks and report a few new ones.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new automatic cryptographic protocol veri- fier based on a simple representation of the protocol by Prolog rules, and on a new efficient algorithm that determines whether a fact can be proved from these rules or not. This verifier proves secrecy properties of the protocols. Thanks to its use of unification, it avoids the problem of the state space explosion. Another advantage is that we do not need to limit the number of runs of the protocol to analyze it. We have proved the correctness of our algorithm, and have implemented it. The experimental results show that many examples of protocols of the literature, including Skeme [24], can be analyzed by our tool with very small resources: the analysis takes from less than 0.1 s for simple protocols to 23 s for the main mode of Skeme. It uses less than 2 Mb of memory in our tests.},

  Abstract                 = {Term Rewriting Systems are now commonly used as a modeling language for programs or systems. On those rewriting based models, reachability analysis, i.e. proving or disproving that a given term is reachable from a set of input terms, provides an efficient verification technique. For disproving reachability (i.e. proving non reachability of a term) on non terminating and non confluent rewriting models, Knuth-Bendix completion and other usual rewriting techniques do not apply. Using the tree automaton completion technique, it has been shown that the non reachability of a term t can be shown by computing an over-approximation of the set of reachable terms and prove that t is not in the approximation. However, when the term t is in the approximation, nothing can be said. In this paper, we refine this approach and propose a method taking advantage of the approximation to compute a rewriting path to the reachable term when it exists, i.e. produce a counter example. The algorithm has been prototyped in the Timbuk tool. We present some experiments with this prototype showing the interest of such an approach w.r.t. verification of rewriting models.},

  Abstract                 = {Today, designers of next-generation embedded processors and software are increasingly faced with short product lifetimes. The resulting time-to-market constraints are contradicting the continually growing processor complexity. Nevertheless, an extensive design-space exploration and product verification is indispensable for a successful market launch. In the last decade, instruction-set simulators have become an essential development tool for the design of new programmable architectures. Consequently, the simulator performance is a key factor for the overall design efficiency. Motivated by the extremely poor performance of commonly used interpretive simulators, research work on fast compiled instruction-set simulation was started ten years ago. However, due to the restrictiveness of the compiled technique, it has not been able to push through in commercial products. In this paper, we tie up with our previous research on retargetable, compiled simulation techniques, and provide a discussion about their benefits and limitations using a particular compiled scheme, static scheduling, as an example. As a conclusion, we eventually present a novel retargetable simulation technique, which combines the performance of traditional compiled simulators with the flexibility of interpretive simulation. This technique is not limited to any class of architectures or applications and can be utilized from architecture exploration up to end-user software development. We demonstrate workflow and applicability of the so-called just-in-time cache-compiled simulation technique by means of state-of-the-art real-world architectures.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past few years the world of industrial controls has borrowed substantially from the world of information systems. Technologies such as Ethernet and TCP/IP have made the interfacing of industrial equipment much easier, but there is now significantly less isolation from the outside world. Network security problems from the business network can be passed on to the process network, putting industrial production and human safety at risk. This paper evaluates these risks to industrial control systems from both accidental and malicious intrusion. The first portion summarizes an analysis of reported incidents in industrial environments and their effects on process systems. The second part describes a series of tests developed and conducted at the BCIT Internet Engineering Lab to determine possible security weaknesses in common programmable logic controllers. Based on these results, recommendations are presented on designing network security for critical industrial control installations.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent introduction of information technologies such as Ethernet® into nuclear industry control devices has resulted in significantly less isolation from the outside world. This raises the question of whether these systems could be attacked by malware, network hackers or professional criminals to cause disruption to critical operations in a manner similar to the impacts now felt in the business world. To help answer this question, a study was undertaken to test a representative control protocol to determine if it had vulnerabilities that could be exploited. A framework was created in which a test could express a large number of test cases in very compact formal language. This in turn, allowed for the economical automation of both the generation of selectively malformed protocol traffic and the measurement of device under test’s (DUT) behavior in response to this traffic. Approximately 5000 protocol conformance tests were run against two major brands of industrial controller. More than 60 categories of errors were discovered, the majority of which were in the form of incorrect error responses to malformed traffic. Several malformed packets however, caused the device to respond or communicate in inappropriate ways. These would be relatively simple for an attacker to inject into a system and could result in the plant operator losing complete view or control of the control device. Based on this relatively small set of devices, we believe that the nuclear industry urgently needs to adopt better security robustness testing of control devices as standard practice.},

Their method reduces protocols with XOR to their XOR-free equivalents, enabling efficient verification by tools such as ProVerif. Although the proposed method works efficiently for verifying secrecy, verification of authentication properties is inefficient and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we improve the work by K ̈ usters and Truderung in two ways. First, we extend their method for authentication verification to a richer class of XOR-protocols by automatically introducing bounded verification. Second, we improve the efficiency of their approach by de- veloping a number of dedicated optimizations. We show the applicability of our work by implementing a prototype and applying it to both exist- ing benchmarks and RFID protocols. The experiments show promising results and uncover a flaw in a recently proposed RFID protocol.},

Outcome of the European project AVISPA, the High-Level Security Protocol Language (HLPSL) aims at providing a means for verifying usual security properties (such as data secrecy) in message exchanges between agents. Nevertheless, verifying the security protocol model does not guarantee that the actual implementation of the protocol will fulfil these properties. We propose in this paper a testing technique that makes it possible to validate an implementation of a security protocol, based on a HLPSL model. We introduce a set of mutation operators for HLPSL models that aim at introducing leaks in the security protocols. The mutated models are then analysed by the AVISPA tool set that will produce counter- example traces leading to the leaks, thus providing the test cases. We report an experiment of our mutation technique on a wide range of security protocols and discuss the relevance of the proposed mutation operators.},

This has resulted in the emergence of the security protocol verifiers to fill the need. In this paper, taking the two popular secu- rity verification tools namely Scyther and ProVerif as the basis, we identify a few security protocols and im- plement them in both Scyther and ProVerif, to aptly evaluate the tools, in terms of the security properties of the selected protocols. In the process, we not only characteristically present a comparative evaluation of the two tools, but also reveal interesting security properties of the protocols selected, showing their strengths and weaknesses. To the best of our knowledge, this is a unique attempt to juxtapose and evaluate the two verifi- cation tools using the selected security protocols.},

However, they often lack security mechanisms and those available in enterprise IT environments are often not suitable for IACS. Other mechanisms require significant manual maintenance which is error prone. In this paper we present an approach that leverages the unique characteristics of IACS, in particular their deterministic behavior and often available formal system description, to reliably detect anomalies and reproducibly generate configurations for security mechanisms such as firewalls. In particular, we extend common IDS technology to also detect an IACS specific anomaly: the missing of required traffic.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, industrial control systems operators are trying to fulfill requirements from upcoming standards and regulation regarding cyber security issues. However, addressing such security requirements by implementing security measures is not a trivial task. Moreover, the creation and maintenance of the configuration for the security measures is prone to error. This research shows that it is possible to derive configuration file(s) to setup different security measures based on the input from system description files. In addition, we highlight an important anomaly in industrial control systems, namely the missing/tardiness of expected traffic. In this paper, we show how the proposed system works by taking IEC 61850 SCD files and generating configuration files for security measures such as firewall and IDS/IPS. Additionally, current IDS/IPS only raise an alert when unexpected traffic appears in the system. They do not alert on the disappearance of the expected traffic. In fact, this type of anomaly is as critical as the other type of anomaly. Thus, we address this anomaly as well in our research.},

  Abstract                 = {The DNP3 protocol is widely used in SCADA systems (particularly electrical power) as a means of communicating observed sensor state information back to a control center. Typical architectures using DNP3 have a two level hierarchy, where a specialized data aggregator receives observed state from devices within a local region, and the control center collects the aggregated state from the data aggregator. The DNP3 communications are asynchronous across the two levels; this leads to the possibility of completely filling a data aggregator's buffer of pending events, when a compromised relay sends overly many (false) events to the data aggregator. This paper investigates the attack by implementing the attack using real SCADA system hardware and software. A Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model is developed for understanding conditions under which the attack is successful and effective. The model is validated by a Möbius simulation model and data collected on a real SCADA testbed.},

Formal methods are clever and without error, therefore using them for verifying such protocols is crucial. In this purpose, we show how to partially represent non-repudiation as a combination of authentications on the Fair Zhou-Gollmann protocol. After discussing the limitations of this method, we define a new one based on the handling of the knowledge of protocol participants. This second method is general and of natural use, as it consists in adding simple annotations in the protocol specification. It is very easy to implement in tools able to handle participants knowledge. We have implemented it in the AVISPA Tool and analyzed the optimistic Cederquist-Corin-Dashti protocol, discovering two attacks. This extension of the AVISPA Tool for handling non-repudiation opens a highway to the specification of many other properties, without any more change in the tool itself.},

Non-repudiation services must ensure that when Alice sends some information to Bob over a network, neither Alice nor Bob can deny having participated in a part or the whole of this communication. Therefore a fair non-repudiation protocol has to generate non- repudiation of origin evidences intended to Bob, and non-repudiation of receipt evidences destined to Alice. In this paper, we clearly de®ne the properties a fair non-repudiation protocol must respect, and give a survey of the most important non-repudiation protocols without and with trusted third party (TTP). For the later ones we discuss the evolution of the TTP's involvement and, between others, describe the most recent protocol using a transparent TTP. We also discuss some ad-hoc problems related to the management of non-repudiation evidences.},

  Abstract                 = {Cryptographic protocols are small programs which involve a high level of concurrency and which are difficult to analyze by hand. The most successful methods to verify such protocols are based on rewriting techniques and automated deduction in order to implement or mimic the process calculus describing the execution of a protocol. We are interested in the intruder deduction problem, that is vulnerability to passive attacks in presence of equational theories which model the protocol specification and properties of the cryptographic operators. In the present paper, we consider the case where the encryption distributes over the operator of an Abelian group or over an exclusive-or operator. We prove decidability of the intruder deduction problem in both cases. We obtain a PTIME decision procedure in a restricted case, the so-called binary case. These decision procedures are based on a careful analysis of the proof system modeling the deductive power of the intruder, taking into account the algebraic properties of the equational theories under consideration. The analysis of the deduction rules interacting with the equational theory relies on the manipulation of Z-modules in the general case, and on results from prefix rewriting in the binary case.},

Con trary to initial belief, Stuxnet wasn't about industrial espionage: it didn't steal, manipulate, or erase information. Rather, Stuxnet's goal was to physically destroy a military target-not just meta phorically, but literally. Let's see how this was done.},

Where only unreliable channel can be guaranteed, all these protocols become impractical. In this study, based on smart card on the receiver side, the authors design a fair non-repudiation protocol that needs no assumptions on the communication channel. The smart card takes over the role of an online TTP server. Without a dedicated TTP server, this protocol is ideal for some ad hoc scenarios where no infrastructure is available. This protocol can also be easily modified to support fair exchange of time-sensitive data. Compared with other traditional security protocols, automatic formal verification of fair non-repudiation protocols is much harder to achieve. The authors use meta-reasoning method to prove that the fair exchange property of this protocol can be reduced to three secrecy properties that fall into the scope of today's most automatic verification tools and therefore can be easily verified. The authors also use a recently proposed automatic method to verify the non-repudiation properties and fairness property of our protocol.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the effort made to define methods for the design of high quality software, experience shows that failures of IT systems due to software errors remain very common and one must admit that even critical systems are not immune from that type of errors. One of the reasons for this situation is that software requirements are generally hard to elicit precisely and it is often impossible to predict all the contexts in which software products will actually be used. Considering the interests at stake, it is therefore of prime importance to be able to establish liabilities when damages are caused by software errors. Essential requirements to define these liabilities are (1) the availability of reliable evidence, (2) a clear definition of the expected behaviors of the components of the system and (3) the agreement between the parties with respect to liabilities. In this thesis, we address these problems and propose a formal framework to precisely specify and establish liabilities in a software contract. This framework can be used to assist the parties both in the drafting phase of the contract and in the definition of the architecture to collect evidence. Our first contribution is a method for the integration of a formal definition of digital evidence and liabilities in a legal contract. Digital evidence is based on distributed execution logs produced by "acceptable log architectures". The notion of acceptability relies on a formal threat model based on the set of potential claims. Another main contribution is the definition of an incremental procedure, which is implemented in the LAPRO tool, for the analysis of distributed logs.},

To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks are a concern.

Si les trop rares initiatives de décloisonnement, adaptant notamment des outils d'un domaine à l'autre, ont abouti à des résultats convaincants, ce décloisonnement reste encore timide et son potentiel considérable. De plus, la récente convergence de risques de sécurité et de sûreté implique des interactions inédites entre exigences et mesures auparavant distinctes, dont la caractérisation nécessite une perspective globale. Dans ces conditions, ces travaux de thèse ont d'abord visé à mieux cerner les notions de sûreté et de sécurité. Ils ont conduit à un cadre référentiel dénommé SEMA (Système-Environnement Malveillant-Accidentel) permettant de positionner ces concepts l'un par rapport à l'autre selon les contextes. La complémentarité des outils de chaque discipline a ensuite été explorée. Cette démarche s'est concrétisée par l'adaptation des BDMP (Boolean logic Driven Markov Processes), issus de la sûreté, au domaine de la modélisation graphique d'attaques. Ils permettent de dépasser bien des limites des techniques classiquement employées. Enfin, l'extension des BDMP a été mise à profit pour fournir un formalisme intégratif, permettant de capturer graphiquement et de caractériser des situations où risques sûreté et sécurité s'exercent conjointement. Pour chacune de ces trois contributions, limites, améliorations et voies alternatives ont été identifiées. Elles n'auront sens que si les communautés de la sûreté et de la sécurité accentuent leur rapprochement, dont cette thèse se veut à la fois une manifestation et une invitation.},

We analyse the clarified protocol using applied pi calculus and the ProVerif tool, and demonstrate that it satisfies the intended properties of the protocol. Moreover, this paper shows that the verification result between the naive interpretation and the clarified interpretation is different.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a general approach for analysis and verification of authentication properties using the theory of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). The paper aims to develop a specific theory appropriate to the analysis of authentication protocols, built on top of the general CSP semantic framework. This approach aims to combine the ability to express such protocols in a natural and precise way with the ability to reason formally about the properties they exhibit. The theory is illustrated by an examination of the Needham-Schroeder (1978) public key protocol. The protocol is first examined with respect to a single run and then more generally with respect to multiple concurrent runs},

Firewalls are the cornerstone of corporate intranet security. Once a company acquires a firewall, a systems administrator must configure and manage it according to a security policy that meets the company's needs. Configuration is a crucial task, probably the most important factor in the security a firewall provides.},

  Abstract                 = {Dispute of transactions is a common problem that could jeopardise business. Hence non-repudiation services are essential in business transactions which provide evidence to enable dispute resolution. To be eligible as non-repudiation evidence, the digital signature on an electronic document should remain valid until its expiry date which is specified by some non-repudiation policy. The conventional approaches are either inefficient or insecure to achieve non-repudiation in electronic commerce. This article presents a practical scheme to secure digital signatures as non-repudiation evidence with an adjustable degree of risk. },

  Abstract                 = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition(SCADA) systems are deeply ingrained in the fabric of critical infrastructure sectors. These computerized real-time process control systems, over geographically dispersed continuous distribution operations, are increasingly subject to serious damage and disruption by cyber means due to their standardization and connectivity to other networks. However, SCADA systems generally have little protection from the escalating cyber threats. In order to understand the potential danger and to protect SCADA systems, in this paper, we highlight their difference from standard IT systems and present a set of security property goals. Furthermore, we focus on systematically identifying and classifying likely cyber attacks including cyber-induced cyber-physical attack son SCADA systems. Determined by the impact on control performance of SCADA systems, the attack categorization criteria highlights commonalities and important features of such attacks that define unique challenges posed to securing SCADA systems versus traditional Information Technology(IT) systems.},
