They are however helpful, in that adherence to them would have prevented a number of published errors. Our principles are informal guidelines; they complement formal methods, but do not assume them. In order to demonstrate the actual applicability of these guidelines, we discuss some instructive examples from the literature.},

We first introduce a new price/effort point for the cost of deploying eavesdropping and relay at- tacks ‚Äì a microcontroller-based interceptor costing less than $100. We look next at EMV protocol failures in the back-end security API, where we describe two new attacks based on chosen-plaintext CBC weaknesses, and on key separation failues. We then consider future modes of attack, specifically looking at combining the phenomenon of phishing (sending unsolicited messages by email, post or phone to trick users into divulging their account details) with chip card sabotage. Our proposed attacks ex- ploit covert channels through the payments network to allow sabotaged cards to signal back their PINS. We hope these new recipes will enliven the debate about the pros and cons of Chip and PIN at both technical and commercial levels.},

  Abstract                 = {‚ÄúNon-repudiation‚Äù, a well known concept in security engineering, provides measures to ensure that participants in a communication process cannot deny having participated. This concept is of eminent importance in business cases based on service oriented architectures (e.g. electronic billing). However, there is no sophisticated standard implementing fair Non-repudiation in such an environment. In this paper, we will introduce a framework providing fair Non-repudiation for Web service messages. It implements an arbitrary, pre-defined protocol using Web services technology, but completely hides the protocol execution from the target Web services. To allow the integration of security requirements in an early stage of the development cycle, a model-driven configuration approach is used. Furthermore, the procedure is not tied to Non-repudiation protocols only, which means that a broad range of protocols can be integrated in a similar way. The framework presented in this paper leverages existing standards and protocols for an efficient adoption in service oriented architectures.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, Nenadiƒá et al. (2004) proposed the RSA-CEGD protocol for certified delivery of e-goods. This is a relatively complex scheme based on verifiable and recoverable encrypted signatures (VRES) to guarantee properties such as strong fairness and non-repudiation, among others. In this paper, we illustrate how an extended logic of beliefs can be helpful to analyze in a formal manner these security properties. This approach requires the previous definition of some novel constructions to deal with evidences exchanged by parties during the protocol execution. The study performed within this framework reveals the lack of non-repudiation in RSA-CEGD and points out some other weaknesses.},

based on a reduction of protocol (in)security problems to a sequence of propositional
satisfiability problems can be used to effectively find attacks on protocols.
In this paper we present an optimized intruder model that may lead in many cases
to shorter attacks which can be detected in our framework by generating smaller
propositional formulae. The key idea is to assume that some of the abilities of the
intruder have instantaneous effect, whereas in the previously adopted approach all
the abilities of the intruder were modeled as state transitions. This required non
trivial extensions to the SAT-reduction techniques which are formally described in
the paper. Experimental results indicate the advantages of the proposed optimization.},

We develop a verified reference implementation of TLS 1.2. Our code fully supports its wire formats, ciphersuites, sessions and connections, re-handshakes and resumptions, alerts and errors, and data fragmentation, as prescribed in the RFCs; it interoperates with mainstream web browsers and servers. At the same time, our code is carefully structured to enable its modular, automated verification, from its main API down to computational assumptions on its cryptographic algorithms. Our implementation is written in F# and specified in F7. We present security specifications for its main components, such as authenticated stream encryption for the record layer and key establishment for the handshake. We describe their verification using the F7 typechecker. To this end, we equip each cryptographic primitive and construction of TLS with a new typed interface that captures its security properties, and we gradually replace concrete implementations with ideal functionalities. We finally typecheck the protocol state machine, and obtain precise security theorems for TLS, as it is implemented and deployed. We also revisit classic attacks and report a few new ones.},

  Abstract                 = {Term Rewriting Systems are now commonly used as a modeling language for programs or systems. On those rewriting based models, reachability analysis, i.e. proving or disproving that a given term is reachable from a set of input terms, provides an efficient verification technique. For disproving reachability (i.e. proving non reachability of a term) on non terminating and non confluent rewriting models, Knuth-Bendix completion and other usual rewriting techniques do not apply. Using the tree automaton completion technique, it has been shown that the non reachability of a term t can be shown by computing an over-approximation of the set of reachable terms and prove that t is not in the approximation. However, when the term t is in the approximation, nothing can be said. In this paper, we refine this approach and propose a method taking advantage of the approximation to compute a rewriting path to the reachable term when it exists, i.e. produce a counter example. The algorithm has been prototyped in the Timbuk tool. We present some experiments with this prototype showing the interest of such an approach w.r.t. verification of rewriting models.},

Consequently, the simulator performance is a key factor for the overall design efficiency. Motivated by the extremely poor performance of commonly used interpretive simulators, research work on fast compiled instruction-set simulation was started ten years ago. However, due to the restrictiveness of the compiled technique, it has not been able to push through in commercial products. In this paper, we tie up with our previous research on retargetable, compiled simulation techniques, and provide a discussion about their benefits and limitations using a particular compiled scheme, static scheduling, as an example. As a conclusion, we eventually present a novel retargetable simulation technique, which combines the performance of traditional compiled simulators with the flexibility of interpretive simulation. This technique is not limited to any class of architectures or applications and can be utilized from architecture exploration up to end-user software development. We demonstrate workflow and applicability of the so-called just-in-time cache-compiled simulation technique by means of state-of-the-art real-world architectures.},

Technologies such as Ethernet and TCP/IP have made the interfacing of industrial equipment much easier, but there is now significantly less isolation from the outside world.

This paper evaluates these risks to industrial control systems from both accidental and malicious intrusion. The first portion summarizes an analysis of reported incidents in industrial environments and their effects on process systems. The second part describes a series of tests developed and conducted at the BCIT Internet Engineering Lab to determine possible security weaknesses in common programmable logic controllers. Based on these results, recommendations are presented on designing network security for critical industrial control installations.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent introduction of information technologies such as Ethernet¬Æ into nuclear industry control devices has resulted in significantly less isolation from the outside world. This raises the question of whether these systems could be attacked by malware, network hackers or professional criminals to cause disruption to critical operations in a manner similar to the impacts now felt in the business world. To help answer this question, a study was undertaken to test a representative control protocol to determine if it had vulnerabilities that could be exploited. A framework was created in which a test could express a large number of test cases in very compact formal language. This in turn, allowed for the economical automation of both the generation of selectively malformed protocol traffic and the measurement of device under test‚Äôs (DUT) behavior in response to this traffic. Approximately 5000 protocol conformance tests were run against two major brands of industrial controller. More than 60 categories of errors were discovered, the majority of which were in the form of incorrect error responses to malformed traffic. Several malformed packets however, caused the device to respond or communicate in inappropriate ways. These would be relatively simple for an attacker to inject into a system and could result in the plant operator losing complete view or control of the control device. Based on this relatively small set of devices, we believe that the nuclear industry urgently needs to adopt better security robustness testing of control devices as standard practice.},

De nombreux op√©rateurs d'importance vitale (OIV) (si ce n‚Äôest tous) sont concern√©s. Que ce soit par malveillance ou dans une perspective terroriste, prendre la main sur un syst√®me SCADA est en g√©n√©ral la garantie d‚Äôavoir une capacit√© de nuisance avec un impact maximal. Ce risque est accru par l‚Äôarchitecture distribu√©e du process et de son architecture associ√©e avec de tr√®s nombreux sites dont certains sont contr√¥l√©s √† distance. De tr√®s nombreuses solutions existent pour la protection des infrastructures informatiques des entreprises, mais ces solutions ne sont pas utilisables directement pour des syst√®mes industriels car ne prenant pas en compte les sp√©cificit√©s de ces syst√®mes. Ces syst√®mes industriels contr√¥lent des process physiques hors du champ des syst√®mes informatiques de l‚Äôentreprise, traditionnellement capables d‚Äôop√©rer de mani√®re ind√©pendante avec des √©quipements tr√®s sp√©cifiques optimis√©s pour le process et des logiciels d√©velopp√©s pour des mat√©riels ¬´ contraints ¬ª (en terme de capacit√© de traitement ou de stockage).

SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems are used in many business sectors such as transportation, energy, telecom or water distribution. Most of these sectors are defined in Europe as mission critical sectors and, as a consequence, critical installations have to be protected. For malicious action or terrorism purpose, enter in a SCADA system allows capability to control the system with a wide impact on the process. This risk is increased by the distributed architecture of the process and the associated infrastructure: there are lot of sites and most of them are remotely controlled. There are plenty of solutions to protect a legacy infrastructure of an information system, but these solutions are not useful for industrial systems, because not taking into account the specificity of those systems. These industrial systems are controlling physical processes outside the IT systems, traditionally able to operate as autarkic systems with very dedicated equipment technology optimized to local process efficiency and software developed for constrained devices (in terms of capability of processing, storage or communication). In this context, the systems are not protected enough, and system design and operational processes were only marginally impacted by IT security concerns. In this global context of protection of the infrastructure and the networks, we plan to explore economically justifiable protection and improve the detection of intrusion to reduce and minimize remaining risks substantially},

Their method reduces protocols with XOR to their XOR-free equivalents, enabling efficient verification by tools such as ProVerif. Although the proposed method works efficiently for verifying secrecy, verification of authentication properties is inefficient and sometimes impossible. In this paper, we improve the work by K Ãà usters and Truderung in two ways. First, we extend their method for authentication verification to a richer class of XOR-protocols by automatically introducing bounded verification. Second, we improve the efficiency of their approach by de- veloping a number of dedicated optimizations. We show the applicability of our work by implementing a prototype and applying it to both exist- ing benchmarks and RFID protocols. The experiments show promising results and uncover a flaw in a recently proposed RFID protocol.},

Outcome of the European project AVISPA, the High-Level Security Protocol Language (HLPSL) aims at providing a means for verifying usual security properties (such as data secrecy) in message exchanges between agents. Nevertheless, verifying the security protocol model does not guarantee that the actual implementation of the protocol will fulfil these properties. We propose in this paper a testing technique that makes it possible to validate an implementation of a security protocol, based on a HLPSL model. We introduce a set of mutation operators for HLPSL models that aim at introducing leaks in the security protocols. The mutated models are then analysed by the AVISPA tool set that will produce counter- example traces leading to the leaks, thus providing the test cases. We report an experiment of our mutation technique on a wide range of security protocols and discuss the relevance of the proposed mutation operators.},

The re- search results and subsequent applications have amply demonstrated that the formal verification tools have indeed helped correct the protocols even after being standardized. However, the standard protocol verifica- tion tools and techniques do not verify the security properties of a cryptographic protocol. This has resulted in the emergence of the security protocol verifiers to fill the need. In this paper, taking the two popular secu- rity verification tools namely Scyther and ProVerif as the basis, we identify a few security protocols and im- plement them in both Scyther and ProVerif, to aptly evaluate the tools, in terms of the security properties of the selected protocols. In the process, we not only characteristically present a comparative evaluation of the two tools, but also reveal interesting security properties of the protocols selected, showing their strengths and weaknesses. To the best of our knowledge, this is a unique attempt to juxtapose and evaluate the two verifi- cation tools using the selected security protocols.},

Such public key systems are usually effective against passive eavesdroppers, who merely tap the lines and try to decipher the message. It has been pointed out, however, that an improperly designed protocol could be vulnerable to an active saboteur, one who may impersonate another user or alter the message being transmitted. Several models are formulated in which the security of protocols can be discussed precisely. Algorithms and characterizations that can be used to determine protocol security in these models are given.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern industrial communication networks are increasingly based on open protocols and platforms that are also used in the office IT and Internet environment. This reuse facilitates development and deployment of highly connected systems, but also makes the communication system vulnerable to electronic attacks. This paper gives an overview of IT security issues in industrial automation systems which are based on open communication systems. First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols. Finally, we illustrate the application of security concepts and tools by brief case studies describing security issues in the configuration and operation of substations, plants, or for remote access.},

They perform vital functions for utility companies including electricity, natural gas, oil, water, sewage, and railroads. However, little attention was given to security considerations in the initial design and deployment of these systems, which has caused an urgent need to upgrade existing systems to withstand unauthorized intrusions potentially leading to terrorist attacks. This research identifies threats faced by SCADA and investigates effective methods to enhance its security by analyzing DNP3 protocols, which has become a de facto industry standard protocol for implementing the SCADA communications. We propose cost-effective implementation alternatives including SSL/TLS, IPsec, object security, encryption, and message authentication object. This report evaluates implementation details of these solutions, and analyzes and compares these approaches. We also suggest new research directions to more adequately secure SCADA communications over the long run.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, industrial control systems operators are trying to fulfill requirements from upcoming standards and regulation regarding cyber security issues. However, addressing such security requirements by implementing security measures is not a trivial task. Moreover, the creation and maintenance of the configuration for the security measures is prone to error. This research shows that it is possible to derive configuration file(s) to setup different security measures based on the input from system description files. In addition, we highlight an important anomaly in industrial control systems, namely the missing/tardiness of expected traffic. In this paper, we show how the proposed system works by taking IEC 61850 SCD files and generating configuration files for security measures such as firewall and IDS/IPS. Additionally, current IDS/IPS only raise an alert when unexpected traffic appears in the system. They do not alert on the disappearance of the expected traffic. In fact, this type of anomaly is as critical as the other type of anomaly. Thus, we address this anomaly as well in our research.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditionally supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks were physically isolated, providing some inherent level of security; yet, as these networks slowly converged with both corporate intranets and the Internet, their security continually eroded. The gradual evolution of SCADA systems has introduced many novel and previously unknown security risks. During the advent of SCADA technologies, a heavy focus was put on providing system robustness, safety, and reliability. Because of this, widely deployed SCADA protocols like Modbus and DNP3 provide no inherent security controls. In this paper, we will propose a novel Modbus alternative capable of providing secure, backward-compatible Modbus message transmission using stream control transmission protocol and hash-based message authentication code technologies. This proposed protocol improvement ensures the availability and integrity of Modbus messages while providing a robust and secure mutual authentication mechanism. Improvements upon the legacy Modbus protocol aim to mitigate common SCADA protocol attack vectors.},

Through collaboration with the Chemical Engineering Department, a functioning SCADA system that is used by the Unit Operations Laboratory course (CHE486) was made available during the 2007 spring semester. The test plan was to replace the current SCADA communication used by part of Unit Operations SCADA system with software modules that use security enhanced DNP3 protocols and observe potential impacts on system operation that may result from the modified protocols. Testing was carried out in conjunction with three Unit Operation labs. As part of each test actual SCADA network traffic was captured for offline analysis and evaluation. An important outcome was the collection of real network data for process control operations, as well as validation of the developed security enhancements, and experience with actual SCADA hardware and software controlling and monitoring a real process. Initial results indicate only a 14% increase in the average bandwidth requirements using the challenge response mechanism, which would be acceptable for most SCADA installations. More importantly, no performance degradation was observed in the application, even at higher challenge frequencies.},

  Abstract                 = {The International Atomic Energy Agency's activities relating to nuclear safety are based upon a number of premises. First and foremost, each Member State bears full responsibility for the safety of its nuclear facilities. States can be advised, but they cannot be relieved of this responsibility. Secondly, much can be gained by exchang- ing experience; lessons learned can prevent accidents. Finally, the image of nuclear safety is international; a serious accident anywhere affects the public's view of nuclear power everywhere. With the intention of strengthening the IAEA's contribution to ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants, leading experts in nuclear safety were invited by the Agency to form the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG). This group serves as a forum for the exchange of information and for the provision of advice to the IAEA on nuclear safety issues of international significance. INSAG seeks not only to identify such issues, but also to draw conclusions on the basis of research on nuclear safety and operational experience. It advises on areas where addi- tional efforts are required. Where possible, it seeks to formulate common safety concepts. The present report deals with the concept of defence in depth in nuclear and radiation safety, discussing its objectives, strategy, implementation and future devel- opment. The report is intended for use by governmental authorities and by the nuclear industry and its supporting organizations. It is intended to stimulate discussion and to promote practical action at all levels to enhance safety. I am pleased to have received this report and am happy to release it to a wider audience.},

  Abstract                 = {The DNP3 protocol is widely used in SCADA systems (particularly electrical power) as a means of communicating observed sensor state information back to a control center. Typical architectures using DNP3 have a two level hierarchy, where a specialized data aggregator receives observed state from devices within a local region, and the control center collects the aggregated state from the data aggregator. The DNP3 communications are asynchronous across the two levels; this leads to the possibility of completely filling a data aggregator's buffer of pending events, when a compromised relay sends overly many (false) events to the data aggregator. This paper investigates the attack by implementing the attack using real SCADA system hardware and software. A Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model is developed for understanding conditions under which the attack is successful and effective. The model is validated by a MoÃàbius simulation model and data collected on a real SCADA testbed.},

  Abstract                 = {The Yubikey is a small hardware device designed to authenticate a user against network-based services. Despite its widespread adoption (over a million devices have been shipped by Yubico to more than 20 000 customers including Google and Microsoft), the Yubikey protocols have received relatively little security analysis in the academic literature. In the first part of this paper, we give a formal model for the operation of the Yubikey one-time password (OTP) protocol. We prove security properties of the protocol for an unbounded number of fresh OTPs using a protocol analysis tool, tamarin. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the security of the protocol with respect to an adversary that has temporary access to the authentication server. To address this scenario, Yubico offers a small Hardware Security Module (HSM) called the YubiHSM, intended to protect keys even in the event of server compromise. We show if the same YubiHSM configuration is used both to set up Yubikeys and run the authentication protocol, then there is inevitably an attack that leaks all of the keys to the attacker. Our discovery of this attack lead to a Yubico security advisory in February 2012. For the case where separate servers are used for the two tasks, we give a configuration for which we can show using the same verification tool that if an adversary that can compromise the server running the Yubikey-protocol, but not the server used to set up new Yubikeys, then he cannot obtain the keys used to produce one-time passwords.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-repudiation protocols have an important role in many areas where secured transactions with proofs of participation are necessary. Formal methods are clever and without error, therefore using them for verifying such protocols is crucial. In this purpose, we show how to partially represent non-repudiation as a combination of authentications on the Fair Zhou-Gollmann protocol. After discussing the limitations of this method, we define a new one based on the handling of the knowledge of protocol participants. This second method is general and of natural use, as it consists in adding simple annotations in the protocol specification. It is very easy to implement in tools able to handle participants knowledge. We have implemented it in the AVISPA Tool and analyzed the optimistic Cederquist-Corin-Dashti protocol, discovering two attacks. This extension of the AVISPA Tool for handling non-repudiation opens a highway to the specification of many other properties, without any more change in the tool itself.},

  Abstract                 = {With the phenomenal growth of the Internet and open networks in general, security services, such as non-repudiation, become crucial to many applications. Non-repudiation services must ensure that when Alice sends some information to Bob over a network, neither Alice nor Bob can deny having participated in a part or the whole of this communication. Therefore a fair non-repudiation protocol has to generate non- repudiation of origin evidences intended to Bob, and non-repudiation of receipt evidences destined to Alice. In this paper, we clearly de¬Æne the properties a fair non-repudiation protocol must respect, and give a survey of the most important non-repudiation protocols without and with trusted third party (TTP). For the later ones we discuss the evolution of the TTP's involvement and, between others, describe the most recent protocol using a transparent TTP. We also discuss some ad-hoc problems related to the management of non-repudiation evidences.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern control systems are becoming complex and interconnected as they are increasingly integrating new information and communication technologies. Many industries like automobile, aeronautics and energy are facing great challenges as their systems are becoming less isolated and vulnerable to external malevolence. Indeed, cyber-attackstargeting industrial infrastructures can engender heavy impactson the safety of humans and environment. In this topical context, we propose a new model based approach: S-cube for SCADA Safety and Security joint modelling. This approach provides a risk analysis framework that enables to evaluate industrial information and control architectures. Starting from the system description, S-cube generates automaticallythe different attack and failure scenarios it is exposed to. This approach is illustrated on a use case for which qualitative and quantitative results are given.},

  Abstract                 = {Cryptographic protocols are small programs which involve a high level of concurrency and which are difficult to analyze by hand. The most successful methods to verify such protocols are based on rewriting techniques and automated deduction in order to implement or mimic the process calculus describing the execution of a protocol. We are interested in the intruder deduction problem, that is vulnerability to passive attacks in presence of equational theories which model the protocol specification and properties of the cryptographic operators. In the present paper, we consider the case where the encryption distributes over the operator of an Abelian group or over an exclusive-or operator. We prove decidability of the intruder deduction problem in both cases. We obtain a PTIME decision procedure in a restricted case, the so-called binary case. These decision procedures are based on a careful analysis of the proof system modeling the deductive power of the intruder, taking into account the algebraic properties of the equational theories under consideration. The analysis of the deduction rules interacting with the equational theory relies on the manipulation of Z-modules in the general case, and on results from prefix rewriting in the binary case.},

Con trary to initial belief, Stuxnet wasn't about industrial espionage: it didn't steal, manipulate, or erase information. Rather, Stuxnet's goal was to physically destroy a military target-not just meta phorically, but literally. Let's see how this was done.},

Where only unreliable channel can be guaranteed, all these protocols become impractical. In this study, based on smart card on the receiver side, the authors design a fair non-repudiation protocol that needs no assumptions on the communication channel. The smart card takes over the role of an online TTP server. Without a dedicated TTP server, this protocol is ideal for some ad hoc scenarios where no infrastructure is available. This protocol can also be easily modified to support fair exchange of time-sensitive data. Compared with other traditional security protocols, automatic formal verification of fair non-repudiation protocols is much harder to achieve. The authors use meta-reasoning method to prove that the fair exchange property of this protocol can be reduced to three secrecy properties that fall into the scope of today's most automatic verification tools and therefore can be easily verified. The authors also use a recently proposed automatic method to verify the non-repudiation properties and fairness property of our protocol.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the effort made to define methods for the design of high quality software, experience shows that failures of IT systems due to software errors remain very common and one must admit that even critical systems are not immune from that type of errors. One of the reasons for this situation is that software requirements are generally hard to elicit precisely and it is often impossible to predict all the contexts in which software products will actually be used. Considering the interests at stake, it is therefore of prime importance to be able to establish liabilities when damages are caused by software errors. Essential requirements to define these liabilities are (1) the availability of reliable evidence, (2) a clear definition of the expected behaviors of the components of the system and (3) the agreement between the parties with respect to liabilities. In this thesis, we address these problems and propose a formal framework to precisely specify and establish liabilities in a software contract. This framework can be used to assist the parties both in the drafting phase of the contract and in the definition of the architecture to collect evidence. Our first contribution is a method for the integration of a formal definition of digital evidence and liabilities in a legal contract. Digital evidence is based on distributed execution logs produced by "acceptable log architectures". The notion of acceptability relies on a formal threat model based on the set of potential claims. Another main contribution is the definition of an incremental procedure, which is implemented in the LAPRO tool, for the analysis of distributed logs.},

  Abstract                 = {Most SCADA and industrial control systems have a limited and deterministic set of behaviors that results with a relatively small amount of variability during normal system operation. Automatic controller commands, operator commands and sensor measurement data within the system may be modified by an attacker to cause system failures. To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks are a concern. This paper provides an overview of the TFIDS and simulation results for attacks on a waste water treatment system with and without the TFIDS.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the issues when attempting to verify security prop- erties of a protocol is how to model the protocol. We intro- duce a method for verifying event freshness in tools which use the applied œÄ-calculus and are able to verify secrecy. Event freshness can be used to prove that a protocol never generates the same key twice. In this work we encode state in the applied œÄ-calculus and perform bounded verification of freshness for MiniDC by using the ProVerif tool. MiniDC is a trivial protocol that for each iteration of a loop gener- ates a unique key and outputs it to a private channel. When verifying freshness, the abstractions of ProVerif cause false attacks. We describe methods which can be used to avoid false attacks that appear when verifying freshness. We show how to avoid some false attacks introduced by private chan- nels, state and protocols that disclose their secret. We con- clude that the method used to verify freshness in MiniDC is impractical to use in more complicated protocols with state.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose ‚Äì Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used by utility companies during the production and distribution of oil, gas, chemicals, electric power, and water to control and monitor these operations. A cyber attack on a SCADA system cannot only result in a major financial disaster but also in devastating damage to public safety and health. The purpose of this paper is to survey the literature on the cyber security of SCADA systems and then suggest two categories of security solutions. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì The paper proposes the use of secure socket layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) and IP security (IPsec) solutions, implemented on the test-bed at the University of Louisville, as the optimal choices when considering the level of security a solution can provide and the difficulty of implementing such a security measure. The paper analyzes these two solution choices, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and present details on efficient ways of implementing these solutions. Findings ‚Äì The SSL/TLS solution to the protocol security using public domain toolkits such as OpenSSL may provide a fast, effective, and economical solution. However, the SSL/TLS protocol and its implementation toolkits have their limitations so this approach may need another enhancement. Practical implications ‚Äì IPsec can be used to provide IP-level security in addition to SSL/TLS. Originality/value ‚Äì The use of these enhanced security approaches in SCADA systems should effectively reduce the vulnerability of these critical systems to malicious cyber attacks, and thereby potentially avoiding the serious consequences of such attacks.},

Si les trop rares initiatives de d√©cloisonnement, adaptant notamment des outils d'un domaine √† l'autre, ont abouti √† des r√©sultats convaincants, ce d√©cloisonnement reste encore timide et son potentiel consid√©rable. De plus, la r√©cente convergence de risques de s√©curit√© et de s√ªret√© implique des interactions in√©dites entre exigences et mesures auparavant distinctes, dont la caract√©risation n√©cessite une perspective globale. Dans ces conditions, ces travaux de th√®se ont d'abord vis√© √† mieux cerner les notions de s√ªret√© et de s√©curit√©. Ils ont conduit √† un cadre r√©f√©rentiel d√©nomm√© SEMA (Syst√®me-Environnement Malveillant-Accidentel) permettant de positionner ces concepts l'un par rapport √† l'autre selon les contextes. La compl√©mentarit√© des outils de chaque discipline a ensuite √©t√© explor√©e. Cette d√©marche s'est concr√©tis√©e par l'adaptation des BDMP (Boolean logic Driven Markov Processes), issus de la s√ªret√©, au domaine de la mod√©lisation graphique d'attaques. Ils permettent de d√©passer bien des limites des techniques classiquement employ√©es.

  Abstract                 = {The growing dependence of critical infrastructures and industrial automation on interconnected physical and cyber based control systems has resulted in a growing and previously unforeseen cyber security threat to SCADA and DCS systems. Industry organizations such as NERC and AGA as well as government organizations like NIST and SANDIA are responding to the cyber security threat faced by control systems and critical infrastructure through the development of guidelines, best practices, test beds, security tools and new technology. Published papers such as (Byres and Lowe, 2005; Miller, 2005; and Greer, 2006) describe the threats and vulnerabilities faced by SCADA and DCS systems and the challenges presented in attempting to secure these systems. Other papers, such as (Byres and Franz, 2006, Strickles, et al 2003) describe the application of existing security technologies and security practices. The articulation of risk is an important component of a comprehensive, realistic, and long term commitment to securing SCADA and DCS systems. Risk assessment methods such as HHM, IIM, and RFRM have been successfully applied to SCADA systems and have highlighted the need for quantifiable metrics. Quantifiable risk analysis falls under the general category of probability risk analysis (PRA) which includes methods like FTA, ETA, and FEMA. What is needed for SCADA and DCS cyber security risk analysis is to quantitatively determine the probability of an attack, the impact of the attack, and the reduction in risk associated with a particular countermeasure. Two recent methods, one based on compromise graphs and one on augmented vulnerability trees, have specifically targeted SCADA security.},

Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be ‚Äúsigned‚Äù using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in ‚Äúelectronic mail‚Äù and ‚Äúelectronic funds transfer‚Äù systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ‚â° 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)).

Recently Cederquist, Corin and Dashti have proposed an optimistic non-repudiation protocol that avoids altogether the use of session labels. We have specified and analysed this protocol using an extended version of the AVISPA Tool and one important fault has been discovered. We describe the protocol, the analysis method, show two attack traces that exploit the fault and propose a correction to the protocol.},

  Abstract                 = {While security issues such as secrecy and authentication have been studied intensively, most interest in non-repudiation protocols has only come in recent years. Non-repudiation services must ensure that when two parties exchange informations over a network, neither one nor the other can deny having participated in this communication. Consequently a non-repudiation protocol has to generate evidences of participation to be used in the case of a dispute. In this paper, we present a description of non-repudiation services, and illustrate them on the Fair Zhou-Gollmann protocol. Then we show how to define non-repudiation properties with the AVISPA tool and explain how they can be automatically verified.},

The SPEAR II tool is a continuation of the highly successful SPEAR project and aims to build on the foundation laid by SPEAR. SPEAR II provides more advanced multidimensional support than SPEAR, enabling protocol specification via a graphical user interface, automated security analysis that applies a number of well-known analysis methods, performance reporting and evaluation, meta-execution and automated code generation.},

These computerized real-time process control systems, over geographically dispersed continuous distribution operations, are increasingly subject to serious damage and disruption by cyber means due to their standardization and connectivity to other networks. However, SCADA systems generally have little protection from the escalating cyber threats. In order to understand the potential danger and to protect SCADA systems, in this paper, we highlight their difference from standard IT systems and present a set of security property goals. Furthermore, we focus on systematically identifying and classifying likely cyber attacks including cyber-induced cyber-physical attack son SCADA systems. Determined by the impact on control performance of SCADA systems, the attack categorization criteria highlights commonalities and important features of such attacks that define unique challenges posed to securing SCADA systems versus traditional Information Technology(IT) systems.},
