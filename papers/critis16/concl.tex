In this paper we present a stateful type of domain specific filtering able to
keep track of the value of predertemined variables.
It guarantees bounded memory and execution time to be resilient against
malicious adversaries since processing one command only depends on the number of
rules and memory to store monitor is controled by only monitoring scalar
variables (or cells when multidimentional).
