In this paper we present a stateful type of domain specific filtering able to
keep track of the value of predetermined variables.
It guarantees bounded memory and execution time to be resilient against
malicious adversaries since processing one command only depends on the number of
rules and memory to store monitor is controlled by only monitoring scalar
variables (or cells when multidimensional).

In the future, we plan on extending the boolean predicates to handle more
complex arithmetic such has "$Equal(2*NewVal+1, LocalVal[1]^2)$".
Such verification are still performed in constant time since we are only
evaluating the expression with concrete values.
We would also be able to specify rules to avoid {\em Denial-of-service}.
Such rules would limit the number of access to a certain variable within a
period of time (\eg no more than 10 Read commands per minute) while keeping
our bounded time and memory properties.
