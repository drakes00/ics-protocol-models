We provide a formal verification of the new industry standard
communication protocol: \opcua, relying its official specifications
\cite{MLD09,opcua_part2,opcua_part4,opcua_part6}.
It is a tidious task since specifications are willingly elusive to
allow interoperability.  This work makes use of \proverif{} a tool
for automatic cryptographic protocol verification.  Surprisingly we
found attacks on both \securechan and \session sub-protocols and
provide adapted counter-measures.

In the future, we aim at testing the attacks we found on real
implementations.  This next work would analyze if existing
implementations are strictly following the specifications or if they
adopt the prudent engineering practices advised in~\cite{AN96} to
circumvent the attacks.  More generaly, we are also interested in
studying how to model integrity properties for messages and
communication flows in \proverif{} since it is one of the requirements
of industrial protocols.
